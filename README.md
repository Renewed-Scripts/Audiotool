# Audiotool – FiveM Audio Converter  

**audiotool** is a simple and efficient tool for converting MP3 files into working in-game audio for FiveM. It automates the process of creating a FiveM-compatible audio resource, making it easier than ever to add custom sounds to your server. 

If you like my work consider giving a ko-fi :)
